      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>After ten years of working in the hospitality field with various event companies across the world, I am very excited to begin my journey in technology. Having donned the "gamer nerd" title with pride my entire life, I am finally ready to take my education to the next level and join the exciting professional world that coding offers. I am eager to dive into the new material with other like-minded individuals who share a passion for this exciting industry.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Pittsburgh, PA</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>When the world is not in a pandemic, I am an avid lover of travel. I've lived in six different cities (both within the U.S. and internationally), and hope that number continues to grow. When I don't have big travel plans, I spend much of my free time exploring the beautiful world of video games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Software and/or Web Development for a gaming company</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Denver, CO</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I am hoping that I will be able to break into the competitive world of gaming design once I spend some time in entry level positions enhancing my skillset. As mentioned above, I would love the flexibiliy of travel with my career, so the remote capabilites of this industry most certainly allure me to furthering my profession in technology.</p>
